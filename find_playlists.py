# So how do I know what file I can work with, without having to request *more* information from Deezer or Spotify? I only have access to the URI.
# The tracks will be in the form "Artist - Album"/"Artist - Track.mp3".
# So you need to store:
#   Artist
#   Album
#   Track
# Honestly, the best solution is probably just to grab the info from Spotify on the inital pass, then store everything in a dict inside the sets. Get the name of the first album artist.
# You may need several setsâ€”one with just the URI, one with all of the info. Or, better, use the URI set to lookup the data in a dict.

# So now:
#   tracks_to_download is a set containing the URIs of new tracks that need to be downloaded
#   playlist_changes is a dictionary containing sets assigned to playlist names (maybe should change to URI? URI file names, file contains actual playlist name? to fix duplicate playlist names)


# After songs are downloaded, combine master_track_set and tracks_to_download
