The two purposes of this program:

 1. Check Spotify for changes to your playlists, downloading the new tracks locally using [deemix](https://old.reddit.com/r/deemix).
 2. Add the local versions of your Spotify playlists to iTunes.
 
Ultimately, the goal is to have a script that you can have running in the background, keeping your iTunes library up-to-date with Spotify.

Using **Spotify** for your music is great because you can access it from anywhere, you don't have to worry about the local files, and it's super easy to use.

Storing music locally (like on **iTunes**) is great because there aren't any ongoing costs, it's more versatile, and you aren't reliant on a corporate entity.

##### So, this will combine the best parts of both.

### The program is taking shape, but still isn't functional. You shouldn't use this yet.
